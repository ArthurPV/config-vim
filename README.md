# Vim config

My ```.vimrc``` configuration.

## Installation 

To start, enter the following command on your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/ArthurPV/vim-config.git
```

Access the file you just downloaded.
Move the .vimrc with the following command:

```bash
mv .vimrc ~/
```
### Install Vundle.vim

Make sure that you have the ```.vim``` folder.
```bash
find ~/.vim
```


If you don't, create one by typing.
```bash
mkdir ~/.vim
```

Follow the [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) documentation to install it.

### Install vim plugins

After installing vim-plug install the vim plugins. Start vim by simply entering vim on your terminal.

You can then type :PlugInstall on vim or if you want to speed up the installation simply type space + u.

### Install coc.nvim

Follow the [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) documentation

And that's it!
